# Nordstjernen for Android

Available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nordstjernen.WebBrowser).
See [`docs/Android.md`](../docs/Android.md) for the build, signing, and release guide.

An Android host app that drives the Nordstjernen browser engine through its C
embedding API (`src/libnordstjernen.h`). The engine — HTML parsing (lexbor),
CSS cascade + layout, JavaScript (QuickJS), image decoding (Wuffs), and cairo
painting — is the same code used on the desktop. The Android UI is a
thin Kotlin shell: a URL bar over a `PageView` that renders the engine's RGBA
output and re-renders as you scroll (with fling), plus pinch- and
double-tap-to-zoom (2D pan when zoomed). Pages are laid out at a phone-width
CSS viewport (device width ÷ display density) and painted scaled by the
density (× the zoom), so text is mobile-sized and crisp at any zoom level —
re-rendered by the engine rather than bitmap-stretched.

## What it does

**Browsing.** Back *and* forward history (kept across process death, and
served from the renderer's back/forward cache rather than refetched), reload
and pull-to-refresh, tap-to-follow-link with a touch-tolerant hit radius,
long-press a link for open / copy / share, long-press text to select it with
a copy / share / select-all action bar, find-in-page, typing into page text
fields through a real `InputConnection`, scrolling of overflow scrollers,
a mobile/desktop viewport toggle, page-title display, downloads through
`DownloadManager`, and the engine's own `about:` pages (start, history,
settings, licences).

**Trust.** A lock or a warning at the head of the URL bar for the page's
transport security, and prompts before a page gets WebGL or the camera —
answered through the same permission channel the GTK shell uses.

**Platform.** `http(s)` `VIEW`-intent handling so the app can be the system
browser (a one-time `RoleManager.ROLE_BROWSER` prompt on first launch offers
exactly that), text shared to the app, `WEB_SEARCH` and `PROCESS_TEXT`
intents, sharing a page or a selection back out, printing through the system
print service (which is also Android's *Save as PDF*), pinning a page to the
launcher, static app shortcuts, handing media the engine cannot play inline
to another app, and following the system dark theme and the "remove
animations" accessibility switch into the page's `prefers-color-scheme` and
`prefers-reduced-motion`.

Rotating the device re-lays the open page out at the new viewport instead of
refetching it, so scripts, form state and the reading position survive.

## Architecture

```
 Kotlin UI (MainActivity, PageView)
        │  JNI
 ns_jni.c  ──►  libnordstjernen.so  (engine: net, dom, css, layout, js, paint)
                       │
                       └─► glib · cairo · pango · pangocairo · harfbuzz ·
                           freetype · fontconfig · libcurl · sqlite3 ·
                           uchardet · libpsl       (cross-compiled deps)
```

The engine drops **GTK 4** on Android: `GdkTexture` is replaced by the
`ns_texture` abstraction (`src/texture.c`). So the Android dependency set is
just the GLib/cairo/pango graphics stack plus networking/storage — all plain C,
no Rust toolchain required. Image decoding is the same in-tree chain as the
desktop: ICO, then Wuffs (PNG/APNG, GIF, BMP, JPEG), then WebP via libwebp,
then SVG in-engine (`src/svg.c`). AVIF needs libavif and is absent from the
Android sysroot, so `.avif` renders a broken-image box.

`ns_browser_render_rgba()` (added to the embedding API for Android) paints a
viewport region straight into an Android `ARGB_8888` Bitmap via
`AndroidBitmap_lockPixels`, so there is no PNG round-trip.

The engine does **not** use GTK widgets — only the GLib/cairo/pango graphics
stack — so no GTK is needed on Android. `src/net.c` and `src/rproc_http.c` carry
small `__ANDROID__` guards (the CA bundle is taken from `CURL_CA_BUNDLE`, which
the host app points at a bundled `cacert.pem`, and the user agent follows the
mobile/desktop page preference).

```

## Building the APK

```sh
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug  # -> app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

The Gradle wrapper is committed, so no `gradle` on `PATH` is needed. Gradle
locates the SDK through `android/local.properties` or `ANDROID_HOME`; neither
is in the tree, so export `ANDROID_HOME` (Windows:
`$env:ANDROID_HOME='C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk'`) or Gradle fails
with "SDK location not found".

Requires JDK 17 or newer, the Android SDK (compileSdk 36), NDK
`30.0.16248370` (`ndkVersion` in `app/build.gradle`; Gradle downloads it), and
CMake 3.22+ from the SDK.
`minSdk` is 34 (Android 14), `targetSdk` 36. Native code is built 16 KB page-size aligned
(Play requirement): the JNI bridge via `ANDROID_SUPPORT_FLEXIBLE_PAGE_SIZES`,
the engine via `-Wl,-z,max-page-size=16384` in the `build-deps.sh` cross-file.

### Two build modes

`CMakeLists.txt` checks for a prebuilt engine at
`app/src/main/jniLibs/<abi>/libnordstjernen.so`:

* **present** — the real JNI bridge (`ns_jni.c`) is compiled and linked against
  it. The app loads and renders real pages.
* **absent** — the stub bridge (`ns_jni_stub.c`) is built so the APK still
  assembles and runs; `NativeBrowser.available` is `false` and the UI shows a
  banner. This lets UI work proceed before the dependency stack is available.

### Producing the engine .so

The Android dependency sysroot is produced by
`nordstjernen-web/nordstjernen-dependencies-build` and published on the public
`sysroot-latest` release. Fetch the prebuilt sysroot and then build the engine
for the emulator ABI:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File android\scripts\fetch-prebuilt-deps.ps1 `
  -Abi x86_64 `
  -Sysroot "$env:USERPROFILE\.cache\nordstjernen-android-sysroot"
```

```sh
ANDROID_NDK_HOME=~/Android/Sdk/ndk/30.0.16248370 \
NORDSTJERNEN_ANDROID_SYSROOT=~/.cache/nordstjernen-android-sysroot \
android/scripts/build-deps.sh x86_64 34
```

The last argument is the NDK platform API level; it must be `<=` `minSdk` (34)
so the engine `.so` — and the prebuilt dependency `.so`s staged beside it — load
on Android 14. Build the dependency sysroot at the same level.

The script generates a meson cross-file for the NDK toolchain, cross-compiles
the `nordstjernen` shared library, and stages it plus its `.so` dependencies
into `jniLibs/<abi>/`. `NORDSTJERNEN_ANDROID_SYSROOT` can point either at a
base directory containing `<abi>/lib/pkgconfig`, or directly at one ABI prefix.
Each run writes diagnostic files under `android/.build/logs/`.

Only the engine's `DT_NEEDED` closure is staged, and any `.so` outside it is
removed from `jniLibs/<abi>/`, so a sysroot carrying libraries this build does
not link (llama/ggml, gobject-introspection, the unused harfbuzz and pcre2
variants) does not ship them in the APK. Nothing is loaded by name at runtime —
Kotlin loads `libnordstjernen_jni.so` and the linker resolves the rest from
`DT_NEEDED` — so the closure is the complete set.

## Status

* **Done & verified on desktop:** engine `__ANDROID__` guards, the
  `ns_browser_render_rgba` (density-scaled) / `ns_browser_page_size` /
  `ns_browser_link_at` / `ns_browser_title` embedding API (compiles clean under
  the project's `--werror` flags, and the render/title paths are exercised by a
  link-test against the built library), the JNI bridge, the full Kotlin app
  (history, reload, link following, fling, intent handling, mobile-width
  rendering, title), and the CMake auto-detect/stub wiring.
* **Wired, CI-built with the prebuilt sysroot:** the Android workflow fetches
  `sysroot-latest`, cross-compiles the engine, and assembles an APK on every
  push via `.github/workflows/android.yml`.
* **Done & verified on desktop (dependency shrink):** the engine no longer
  needs GTK 4 — `GdkTexture` is abstracted behind `ns_texture`
  (`src/texture.c`; a GDK wrapper on desktop, a BGRA buffer on Android). The
  desktop build is byte-for-byte behaviourally identical.
* **Android sources verified-compiling:** `android/scripts/check-android-sources.sh`
  re-checks every engine translation unit under the Android configuration
  (`__ANDROID__`) with `clang -fsyntax-only`, reusing
  the desktop `compile_commands.json` — no NDK required. It runs in the Linux
  CI job, so Android-source regressions are caught on every build. All 61
  engine sources pass.
