# Software architecture

How Nordstjernen is built, from the process model down to each engine
subsystem, and how those choices compare with Firefox (Gecko), Chrome
(Blink), and Ladybird (LibWeb).

Snapshot: **1.0.31-dev**, 2026-10-09. This is a living map of the codebase;
the source is the source of truth. File references are given as
`path:line` and were accurate at the snapshot revision.

The poster above maps the process tree, the source modules inside each
process, their external dependencies, and the information flows between
them (IPC control channel, shared-memory framebuffer, media command and
frame paths, page-load pipeline). Regenerate it with graphviz + pillow
via `scripts/arch-diagram/build_poster.py` followed by
`scripts/arch-diagram/compose.py`.

## 1. What Nordstjernen is

Nordstjernen is a web browser **written from scratch in C**, using GTK 4
for its desktop shell and libcurl for networking. It is an **independent
engine**: there is no Gecko, WebKit, or Blink lineage, no forked layout
or CSS code, nothing imported from another browser. The HTML→DOM parser
(lexbor), the JavaScript engine (QuickJS-ng), the image decoders
(Wuffs, libwebp), and the WebAssembly runtime (WAMR) are proven
third-party libraries vendored and integrated in-tree; the DOM, the CSS
cascade and selector engine, layout, paint, the media pipeline, and all
of the Web-platform bindings are original code.

The whole engine is roughly **230,000 lines of C** (`src/`, excluding the
vendored lexbor, QuickJS, and WAMR trees), small enough for a single person to
read and audit end to end. That constraint drives most of the
architecture below.

### Guiding constraints

- **Minimal, compact, auditable.** One human should be able to read the
  source. This rules out a code-generated binding layer, a GPU
  compositor, and a multi-megabyte dependency tree.
- **Secure by construction.** Each tab's engine runs in its own
  sandboxed OS process (seccomp + Landlock on Linux). There is **no
  JIT** anywhere — neither for JavaScript (QuickJS is a bytecode
  interpreter) nor for WebAssembly (WAMR runs its fast interpreter),
  so the renderer never generates or maps executable code at runtime and
  presents no W^X surface.
- **Standards-first, not browser-mimicking.** Behaviour is measured
  against the WHATWG/W3C/TC39 spec text section by section (see
  [HTML-compatibility.md](HTML-compatibility.md),
  [CSS-compatibility.md](CSS-compatibility.md)), not against another
  browser's quirks.
- **No telemetry.** The browser does not phone home. Safe-browsing is a
  local on-device blocklist with no network callout.
- **Reuse proven libraries, write the browser.** Hard, well-solved
  problems (HTML tokenisation, WHATWG URL parsing, a conformant JS
  interpreter, memory-safe image decoding) are delegated to vendored
  libraries; the browser-specific parts are written in-house.

---

## 2. Process model

A running Nordstjernen desktop session is a small tree of processes,
not one monolith. From the top:

```
nordstjernen (watchdog supervisor)
└── nordstjernen (GTK shell — thin, engine-free UI)
    ├── nordstjernen-renderer   (tab 1 — sandboxed engine)
    ├── nordstjernen-audio      (tab 1 — lazy, spawned by the shell)
    ├── nordstjernen-video      (tab 1 — lazy, spawned by the shell)
    ├── nordstjernen-renderer   (tab 2 — sandboxed engine)
    └── …
```

**Watchdog supervisor.** A normal launch turns the process you start
into a tiny supervisor (`ns_watchdog_run_supervisor`,
`src/watchdog.c:548`, entered from `src/gtk/appmain.c:554`) that spawns
the real GUI shell as a child and restarts it if it crashes or hangs,
bounded by a crash-loop limit of 5 restarts per 60 s
(`src/watchdog.c:398`). A dedicated heartbeat thread inside the shell
(`src/watchdog.c:57`) turns a wedged main loop into a non-zero exit the
supervisor can recover. See [watchdog.md](watchdog.md).

**GTK shell.** The shell (`src/gtk/appmain.c`, `src/gtk/procview.c`) is
deliberately thin and **engine-free**: it owns windows, tabs, the
address bar, and input, but it never parses HTML, runs CSS, or executes
JavaScript. Each tab (`NsProcView`) blits a shared-memory framebuffer
and forwards input to its renderer.

**Per-tab renderer.** The engine — HTML parse, CSS cascade, layout,
Cairo/Pango paint, the QuickJS runtime, networking — runs inside one
sandboxed `nordstjernen-renderer` process **per tab**
(`src/renderer_http.c`, spawned by the per-view worker at
`src/gtk/procview.c:1552`). A renderer crash is contained to its tab and
transparently restarted, up to `NS_PROC_MAX_RESTARTS` times
(`src/gtk/procview.c:3339`). This is a **process-per-tab** boundary; a
finer process-per-site boundary is noted as future work in
[tab-isolation.md](tab-isolation.md).

**Media helpers.** Audio and video decode outside the sandboxed renderer
in short-lived helper processes spawned by the shell — see
[§12](#12-media-audio-and-video).

**Single-process mode.** `--single-process` (or `NS_SINGLE_PROCESS=1`)
serves every tab from one in-process engine over the same IPC protocol
(`src/rproc_inproc.c`), trading the renderer sandbox and crash
containment for footprint and debuggability. **Headless** modes
(`--headless`/`--dump`/`--eval`/`--inspect`/`--wpt`/`--act`) are a
separate path again: they run the engine in-process with no shell and no
IPC at all (`ns_run_headless`, `src/gtk/appmain.c:418`). See
[single-process-mode.md](single-process-mode.md).

---

## 3. IPC: an HTTP/JSON control channel + a shared-memory framebuffer

The shell↔renderer boundary is one of Nordstjernen's more distinctive
choices. Rather than a bespoke binary protocol, every control message is
a **plain HTTP/1.1 POST with a small JSON body**, and only the rendered
pixels travel through shared memory (see [Rendering.md](Rendering.md)).

- **Transport.** An `AF_UNIX` `socketpair` on POSIX (the child end is
  `dup2`'d to fd 3, `src/rproc_http.c:184`, which the renderer reads and
  writes, `src/renderer_http.c:222`), inherited stdio pipes on Windows, or a `stdio` mode for JVM/Android embedders. Framing is
  minimal HTTP/1.1 in `src/ipc_http.c` (`http_write_request`,
  `http_read_head`).
- **Messages are POST paths**, all dispatched in `ns_renderer_session_handle`
  (`src/renderer_serve.c:587`): `/open`, `/render`, `/tick`, `/link`,
  `/click`, `/key`, `/hover`, `/scroll`, `/select`, `/find`, `/viewport`,
  `/eval`, `/console`, `/media`, `/print`, `/export`, `/quit`, and others. The client-side
  wrappers live in `src/rproc_http.c`.
- **Frames are shared memory.** The shell backs the framebuffer with an
  anonymous `memfd_create` (Linux) or an immediately-unlinked `shm_open`
  segment (other Unix), passes the descriptor to the renderer over
  `SCM_RIGHTS` (`http_send_fd`, `src/ipc_http.c:75`), and the renderer
  wraps it directly as a Cairo ARGB32 surface. Windows creates an
  unnamed inheritable file mapping and passes the handle. A full-frame
  `/render` reply carries only geometry in `X-*` headers (`X-W`, `X-H`,
  `X-Stride`, `X-Anim`, `X-PageW`, `X-PageH`, `X-ScrollY`) and an empty
  body; a tiled reply lists its layers and tiles in the body (see
  [Rendering.md](Rendering.md)).
- **Renderer→shell side-channels** ride the `/render` reply as extra
  headers drained from the engine's pending queues: `X-Nav` (a
  script-initiated navigation), `X-Audio` (media-helper commands),
  `X-WebGL` (WebGL activity), `X-Camera` (a permission prompt),
  `X-Download` (a download offer), and `X-Window-Action` (a
  script-requested window action).

The protocol is readable in a trace and trivial to extend, which is the
whole point: a browser's process boundary is normally the least
inspectable part of the system.

---

## 4. The rendering pipeline

Inside a renderer, a page moves through a fixed sequence. `src/engine.c`
orchestrates the synchronous form used by headless/export; `src/render.c`
is the reusable style→layout core that both `engine.c` and the live
browser share.

```
network bytes
  → charset decode        (src/html.c — uchardet, WHATWG label table)
  → HTML parse            (src/html_lexbor.c — lexbor tokeniser + tree builder)
  → DOM tree              (ns_node, src/dom.c)
  → CSS cascade + style   (src/css.c — ns_node* → ns_style*)
  → layout                (src/layout.c — the ns_box tree)
  → paint                 (src/paint.c — Cairo + Pango)
  → shared-memory framebuffer → shell blit
```

The same tree feeds paper. `ns_browser_print_pages`
(`src/libnordstjernen.c:1822`, paginating through `src/print.c`) lays
the document out at the sheet size `@page` asks for, cuts it into sheets
at the breaks `break-before`/`break-after`/`break-inside` allow, renders
one cairo recording surface per sheet and restores the on-screen layout.
In single-process mode the shell takes those surfaces directly; across
the process boundary the renderer's `/print` handler rasterises each
sheet to a PNG in the runtime directory and the shell loads them back
(`ns_rproc_http_print`). Either way `src/gtk/procview.c` hands the sheets
to `GtkPrintOperation` and the platform's own print dialog. See
[printing.md](printing.md).

**Charset decode.** `ns_html_decode_body_full` (`src/html.c:733`) applies
BOM sniffing, then the declared charset, then UTF-8 validation, then
**uchardet** detection, then a Windows-1252 fallback. Dangerous
encodings (UTF-7, HZ, ISO-2022) are rejected.

**HTML parse.** `ns_html_parse` (`src/html_lexbor.c:761`) drives the
in-tree **lexbor** tokeniser and tree constructor (scripting flag on),
then converts the lexbor tree into the native DOM
(`lxb_to_nd_root`, `:197`), preserving quirks mode, declarative shadow
DOM, and standards media-metadata extraction. The lexbor document is
kept alive as backing store on the DOM root.

**Style + layout core.** `ns_render_relayout_profile` (`src/render.c:681`)
sets the viewport, runs `ns_css_compute` to produce the `ns_node* →
ns_style*` table, builds the `ns_box` layout tree with `ns_layout_build`,
and — only if the page uses container queries — measures containers and
runs a second cascade+layout pass. It then publishes the style table and
layout root to the JS engine so scripts see live computed styles and
geometry.

A second cascade can reuse the previous one: the incremental pass keeps
the prior style table and recomputes only the subtrees marked dirty by
`ns_css_mark_restyle_dirty`. Eligibility is decided by a signature over
the participating stylesheets, taken from each sheet's **serial** — a
monotonic id stamped at parse time. Identity by address would be wrong
here, because a reparsed `<style>` routinely lands on the freed block of
the sheet it replaced.

**Forced synchronous reflow.** Script reads that depend on style or
geometry (`getComputedStyle`, `getBoundingClientRect`, `offsetWidth`,
`scrollIntoView`, `checkVisibility`, `elementFromPoint`, `innerText`)
call `ns_js_flush_layout`, which relayouts whenever the document is
dirty. There is no per-task or wall-clock throttle on this path — CSSOM
requires the read to observe every mutation that precedes it. The
rendering tick throttles independently (an interval derived from the
measured relayout cost, plus an oscillation dampener); that is where
throttling belongs. The cost of the guarantee is that, with no
incremental layout invalidation, a write/read thrash loop pays a full
cascade and box-tree rebuild per iteration.

**Paint.** `ns_paint` (`src/paint.c:9587`) walks the box tree into a
Cairo surface. See [§7](#7-paint-text-and-fonts).

---

## 5. The DOM

The DOM is a hand-rolled tree of `ns_node` (`src/dom.h:70`), not a
wrapper over lexbor's tree. Each node carries its `kind`
(document/doctype/element/text/comment), tag name, text, a
singly-linked attribute list, and parent/child/sibling pointers. Per
document, `ns_node` maintains **id, class, and tag indexes** (hash
tables built in bulk in document order, `src/dom.c:1604`) plus an
attribute Bloom filter for fast selector rejection, so `getElementById`
and selector matching don't rescan the tree.

The bridge from lexbor to `ns_node` is `lxb_node_convert`
(`src/html_lexbor.c:61`), which copies attributes (including namespaced
ones), tags SVG/MathML nodes with their namespace, and follows
`<template>` content. Node→JS wrapper identity is cached on the node
itself (see [§8](#8-the-javascript-engine)).

---

## 6. The CSS engine

`src/css.c` (~34,000 lines) is a full cascade and selector engine with
its own data model in `src/css.h`: 240+ longhand properties, a tagged
value union (keyword/length/color/calc/shadow/gradient/grid-tracks/
transform/…), specificity-carrying selectors, and a computed `ns_style`
record that holds a `values[]` array plus sub-styles for each supported
pseudo-element and a custom-property (`--var`) map.

- **Cascade.** `ns_css_compute` parses and caches the
  UA sheet once, builds per-sheet rule indexes, computes cascade-layer
  ranks, registers `@property` defaults, and walks the DOM. Layer ranks
  come from the layer *tree*, not declaration order: every registered
  name is expanded into its ancestor paths and sorted so that sublayers
  fall inside their parent and a layer's own declarations act as its
  implicit final sublayer (`css_layer_ranks_finalize`). Per element,
  matches are gathered from the UA sheet, presentational hints, and
  author sheets, then sorted by origin → layer → specificity → source
  order, with `!important`, `revert`, `inherit`/`initial`, and inherited
  fill-down resolved in `cascade_for` (`src/css.c:29322`). Font-relative
  and viewport/container units are resolved during the cascade.
- **Selectors.** `ns_css_selector_matches` (`src/css.c:25737`) matches
  the rightmost compound then walks combinators right-to-left (child,
  `+`, `~`, descendant). The pseudo-class/element coverage is broad,
  including `:has()`, `:is()`/`:where()`, structural, state, and the
  HTML-connected pseudo-classes.
- **UA stylesheet.** The `kUa` literal (`src/css.c:28569`) supplies the
  default rendering (display types, heading scale, list markers, form
  controls, `[hidden]`, `dialog`, popover). It is the browser's
  implementation of the HTML Rendering section — the sections/grouping
  elements have no element-specific code path, only UA CSS.
- **Media & container queries.** `ns_css_media_query_matches`
  (`src/css_media.c:1179`) evaluates width/height/aspect-ratio/resolution/
  orientation/`prefers-color-scheme`/`prefers-reduced-motion`/pointer/
  hover and range syntax.

---

## 7. Layout, paint, text, and fonts

**Layout** (`src/layout.c`, ~18,000 lines) builds the `ns_box` tree from
the style table. `layout_box` (`src/layout.c:10191`) dispatches by box
kind into the implemented formatting contexts:

| Context | Entry | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Block | `layout_block` | margin collapsing, multicol |
| Inline | `inline_layout` | Pango-shaped runs, atomic inlines |
| Flex | `layout_flex_row`/`layout_flex_column` | `order`, wrapping |
| Grid | `layout_grid` | track sizing, spans, named areas |
| Table | `layout_table` | colspan/rowspan, border models |
| MathML | `ns_math_measure` | presentation MathML |

**Paint.** Page painting is **entirely Cairo software rendering** —
there is no GPU compositor for page content. `ns_browser_render_argb32`
(`src/libnordstjernen.c:2273`) wraps the shared-memory buffer directly as
a Cairo ARGB32 surface and calls `ns_paint` (`src/paint.c:9587`), whose
recursive `paint_walk` (`:8896`) culls hidden/offscreen boxes, applies
opacity/blend/mask groups, sticky offsets, 2D and 3D transforms, and
clip-paths, and paints positioned/z-indexed children in stacking order.

**Text** is shaped with **Pango** — on desktop through the **ns-pango**
fork pinned as a meson subproject (`subprojects/ns-pango.wrap`, included
as `"ns_pango.h"`), which caches shaped glyph strings across layouts;
Android and iOS link the system Pango. `@font-face`
fonts are fetched, converted from WOFF to SFNT (`src/font.c`) and from
WOFF2 to SFNT over libbrotlidec when it is available (`src/woff2.c`), and
registered with Fontconfig so the Pango-FC fontmap can use them.

**Animation.** `src/anim.c` tracks CSS transitions and `@keyframes`.
The per-frame pump `ns_browser_tick` (`src/libnordstjernen.c:1866`)
advances the animator, dispatches transition/animation events, runs
`requestAnimationFrame` callbacks, pumps the GLib main context, and
relayouts on mutation. `ns_browser_animating` gates whether the shell
runs a continuous frame loop or renders on demand.

**Images** are decoded by `ns_image_decode_bytes` (`src/image.c:253`),
which tries decoders in a fixed content-sniffed order and returns a
texture: **ICO/CUR → Wuffs** (memory-safe: PNG/APNG, GIF, BMP, JPEG,
WebP) **→ libwebp** (animated/extended WebP) **→ libavif** (if built)
**→ libjxl** (if built) **→ SVG**, rendered in-engine (`src/svg.c`). Nothing follows: a format none of
these cover fails to decode rather than falling through to a
plugin-loaded decoder.

---

## 8. The JavaScript engine

The engine is an in-tree fork of **quickjs-ng** (`src/quickjs/`, version
0.17.0), a compact **bytecode interpreter with no JIT**. `-Dquickjs=quickjs`
builds the same binding on Fabrice Bellard's original QuickJS instead,
through the `src/ns_quickjs.h` adapter ([quickjs.md](quickjs.md)). Each browsing
context gets one `JSRuntime` + `JSContext`, created in `ns_js_new`
(`src/js.c:57052`) with a 2 GB memory cap (`js_memory_cap_mb`) and a
5 MB stack.

**DOM bindings.** All DOM node types share **one** `JSClassID`
(`ns_element_class_id`); the C `ns_node *` is the JS object's opaque
pointer, and node→wrapper identity is cached on the node so the same
node always yields the same JS object. Types are distinguished by
**per-kind prototypes**, and `instanceof` is driven by a custom
`[Symbol.hasInstance]` over a tag→constructor table covering ~70 HTML
element interfaces. Genuinely dynamic surfaces (Window named properties,
`CSSStyleDeclaration`, `DOMTokenList`, live collections, `dataset`) use
QuickJS **exotic objects**. `src/js.c` is the single largest file in the
tree (~67,000 lines) because it hosts essentially the whole Web-platform
binding surface.

**Event loop.** The engine has no internal loop; JS work is **pumped
from the host render loop**. Microtasks (promises, `queueMicrotask`)
drain via `JS_ExecutePendingJob`; timers are GLib sources; `requestAnimationFrame`
callbacks are drained each frame with a clamped high-resolution
timestamp. A per-invocation soft budget and a hard **60-second wall-clock
monitor** are enforced through `JS_SetInterruptHandler`
(`ns_js_interrupt_cb`, `src/js.c:580`); time spent blocked in a nested
main loop (a synchronous fetch) is credited back so I/O doesn't burn the
budget.

**Web-platform APIs** implemented over this engine include `fetch`/XHR
(driving the C networking layer), **WebCrypto** (`crypto.subtle` over
OpenSSL libcrypto, `src/webcrypto.c`), **IndexedDB** (a low-level
SQLite-backed native backend with the W3C object model built in
`polyfills.js`), **WebSocket** (over libcurl's native WS API, `src/ws.c`),
**EventSource**, **Web Workers** (each a separate `GThread` with its own
runtime, cross-thread messaging by structured clone), `localStorage`/
`sessionStorage`, Canvas 2D (Cairo, `src/js_canvas.c`), an ICU-free
**Intl** (`src/js_intl.c`) and **Temporal** (`src/js_date.c`), and the
observer APIs.

**WebAssembly** runs on **WAMR** (`src/wamr/`, the fast interpreter
with reference-types and bulk-memory, no JIT/AOT); `src/wasm.c` binds the
`WebAssembly` JS API over it.

**Polyfills.** A ~500 KB `data/js/polyfills.js` bundle is embedded at
build time and evaluated after the native bindings install. It builds
higher-level spec object models over thin native backends (the whole
IndexedDB interface over `__nd_idb`), and adds faithfulness shims (making
patched methods report `[native code]`). It is syntax-verified against
the in-tree `qjs` at build time.

Some surfaces live **entirely** in the bundle rather than in `js.c` —
the CSSOM rule model (`CSSRule`/`CSSStyleRule`/`CSSGroupingRule`,
`document.styleSheets`, `style.sheet`), `NodeIterator`/`TreeWalker`/
`Range`/`NodeFilter`. Because the bundle runs last, whatever it defines
wins, so a half-finished C implementation of the same API is not
harmless: it is dead code that can still shadow the real one if it
installs on a nearer prototype. Extend the bundle for these APIs, and
delete rather than keep stubs on the C side.

**Bytecode cache.** `src/bytecode_cache.c` caches compiled QuickJS
bytecode, keyed by SHA-256 of the source, in a two-tier memory+disk
cache (16 MB memory LRU; on-disk sharded under the cache dir), so large
scripts skip recompilation across loads.

---

## 9. Networking

Networking is built on **libcurl** (`src/net.c`, ~7,000 lines):

- **HTTP/2 by default** (`CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2TLS`); curl's **HTTP/3** is
  opt-in (`NS_FORCE_HTTP3`, when libcurl is built with it).
- **Swappable transport.** A single hop goes through `ns_hop_transport()`
  (`src/net_backend.h`). `-Dhttp_backend=nghttp2` replaces the curl hop
  with an in-tree libnghttp2 + OpenSSL client (`src/net_http2.c`) that
  multiplexes streams per connection and upgrades to HTTP/3 over QUIC
  after `Alt-Svc` when ngtcp2/nghttp3/gnutls are present. Redirects,
  HSTS, cache, and cookies stay above the hop and are shared. See
  [http-backends.md](http-backends.md).
- **WHATWG URL** parsing, resolution, origin/host/site extraction all
  route through lexbor's URL module (`ns_url_*`), so there is no separate
  URL library.
- **Same-origin / same-site** are computed with `ns_url_same_origin` and
  `ns_url_is_same_site` (the latter using the **Public Suffix List** via
  libpsl for the registrable domain).
- **Fetch metadata & client hints.** Navigations send the full
  `Sec-Fetch-*` set, `Sec-CH-UA*` under a Chrome identity,
  `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests`, and a compat-mode-selectable User-Agent
  (Chrome/Firefox/Ladybird presets).
- **HSTS** and an **HTTPS-first** upgrade path (on by default, the
  `https_first` config key).
- **HTTP cache**: a **SQLite-indexed** cache with on-disk bodies
  (`src/cache.c`), honouring ETag/Last-Modified.
- **Cookies** partitioned per site; JS-set cookies persisted in a
  sibling file curl never overwrites.

The renderer performs its own fetching, cookie, and cache I/O today;
[tab-isolation.md](tab-isolation.md) records browser-process brokering of
the network as intended future hardening.

---

## 10. Security and sandboxing

Confinement is layered, and the **out-of-process renderer is the real
boundary** (`src/security.c`).

- **Linux — Landlock + seccomp.** The renderer seals a **Landlock**
  filesystem ruleset (`ns_security_sandbox_init`, `src/security.c:417`):
  read+exec on system library dirs, read-only on config/certs/proc/sys,
  and read-write only on its own runtime, cache, and downloads
  directories. It then loads a **seccomp-bpf** filter
  (`ns_security_seccomp_init`, `:933`) whose default action is
  fail-with-`EPERM`, allowing ~260 named syscalls and **denying `execve`,
  `ptrace`, `mount`, `setuid`, `bpf`, and other escape primitives by
  omission**. Both are sealed before the renderer opens any page
  (`src/renderer_http.c:261`). The shell gets Landlock only (it must
  `fork`/`execv` renderers, which the no-`execve` filter would block).
- **macOS** applies a Seatbelt filesystem-write-confinement profile;
  **Windows** applies `SetProcessMitigationPolicy` (DEP, ASLR,
  strict-handle, image-load, child-process restrictions). Other
  platforms are unsandboxed no-ops.
- **Same-Origin Policy / CORS.** Enforced through `ns_url_same_origin`;
  `fetch`/XHR responses are gated by a CORS check
  (`cors_allows`, `src/js.c:9366`).
- **CSP** (`src/csp.c`) parses and enforces 14 directives including
  `frame-ancestors`, with source-list matching, nonces, and
  sha-256/384/512 inline hashes.
- **No JIT** means no runtime code generation for JS or wasm, removing
  the W^X attack surface entirely; runaway scripts are bounded by the
  60-second interrupt monitor rather than a kill.
- **Safe-browsing** (`src/safebrowsing.c`) is a **local** SHA-256 host
  blocklist with an interstitial — no network callout, no telemetry.

See [tab-isolation.md](tab-isolation.md), [watchdog.md](watchdog.md).

---

## 11. Threading model

A renderer is **single-main-thread**: DOM, CSS, layout, Cairo/Pango
paint, and page JavaScript all live on one thread running a GLib main
loop. Background threads exist only for inherently blocking or
self-contained work — network I/O, image decoding,
WebSocket/EventSource pumps, and Web Workers (each its own runtime) —
and every off-thread result is handed back through a GLib main-context
invocation before it touches shared state. The invariant: **nothing
outside the main thread ever touches an `ns_node`, a layout box, or a
live page `JSContext`.** See [threading.md](threading.md).

---

## 12. Media: audio and video

Media decodes **outside** the sandboxed renderer, in helper processes
the shell spawns per tab and drives with the commands the renderer
emits on the `X-Audio` side-channel (see [media.md](media.md)):

- **`nordstjernen-audio`** (`src/audio/main.c`) decodes to PCM in-tree —
  pl_mpeg (MPEG-1/MP2), minimp3 (MP3), and libav (Opus/Vorbis) — and
  plays through SDL2. It speaks a one-command-per-line text protocol over
  stdin/stdout.
- **`nordstjernen-video`** (`src/videoproc/main.c`) decodes MSE/WebM
  frames and publishes BGRA frames into its **own shared-memory ring**,
  which the shell maps read-only and composites over the page surface
  each frame tick.

The always-on, in-tree codecs are **pl_mpeg** (MPEG-1) and **minimp3**
(MP3). **WebM (VP9/VP8 + Opus/Vorbis)** is the one FFmpeg-backed
extension over the system `libav*` libraries — required on Linux/Windows,
auto-detected on macOS. Nordstjernen deliberately ships **no general
media stack**.

---

## 13. Graphics APIs

- **WebGL 1/2** (`src/webgl.c`) maps the API more or less directly onto
  OpenGL ES through a toolkit-independent offscreen GL context
  (`src/glctx.c`) and libepoxy — a surfaceless EGL context on Linux, CGL
  on macOS, WGL on Windows. There is no ANGLE layer and no command-stream validator.
  It is enabled by default, globally switchable in Settings, and announced
  in the status bar when a page uses it. The result renders into an FBO, is
  read back, and composited into the Cairo scene like any other image.
- **WebGPU** (`src/webgpu.c`) is **experimental**, layered over the
  external wgpu-native library (headers vendored, library never
  committed). It is a required part of the build on glibc Linux, macOS,
  and Windows — fetched through a pinned meson wrap when not installed —
  and optional elsewhere; `-Dwebgpu=disabled` drops it. It is on at
  runtime by default, can be switched off in Settings (the `webgpu`
  config key), and `--enable-webgpu` turns it on even when Settings has
  it off.
- **Canvas 2D** (`src/js_canvas.c`) is Cairo+Pango backed.

## 14. Storage, i18n, and the local start page

- **Storage backends.** SQLite backs the HTTP cache (`src/cache.c`) and
  IndexedDB (`src/idb.c`); `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` are per-origin
  partitioned maps flushed to disk; config is a plain key-file under the
  user config dir.
- **i18n.** UI strings are English-source and translated at startup
  through an in-tree catalogue lookup (`src/i18n.c`, `data/i18n/*.lang`).
  There is no gettext dependency.
- **Start page.** `about:start` is a compact search-focused home page.
  Nordstjernen contains no built-in AI assistant and exposes no AI-style
  Web APIs to pages.

## 15. Build, embedding, and platforms

- **Build system:** meson + ninja. Optional features (`gtk`, `wasm`,
  `audio`, `webgpu`, `avif`, `jxl`, `ns-pango`) are meson feature flags,
  and `http_backend` and `quickjs` are combo options; ccache is picked up
  automatically. The vendored lexbor, QuickJS, and WAMR trees are loaded
  via `subdir()` and expose declared dependencies directly, not as
  subprojects.
- **Embedding:** the engine is exposed as a shared library
  `libnordstjernen` with a plain-C API (`src/libnordstjernen.h`,
  `ns_browser_*`) that carries no GLib or GTK types — the same
  synchronous pipeline the headless driver uses. See
  [Embedding.md](Embedding.md).
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows (MSYS2/MinGW), plus Android and a
  JVM binding (`java/`, JNI over the same C API) and iOS. Desktop uses
  GTK 4; the engine core is GTK-optional.
- **License:** Nordstjernen Source License v1.0 or GNU GPL version 3 or
  later, at your option (`LicenseRef-NSL-1.0 OR GPL-3.0-or-later`).

## 16. Comparison with Firefox, Chrome, and Ladybird

Nordstjernen sits in a specific corner of the design space: an
**independent** engine like Ladybird and (historically) Gecko, but
written in **C** with **no JIT** and an unusually **small, reuse-heavy**
codebase. The table summarises; the notes explain.

| Dimension | Nordstjernen | Firefox (Gecko) | Chrome (Blink) | Ladybird (LibWeb) |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Language | C | C++ and Rust | C++ (some Rust) | C++ (moving to Swift) |
| Engine lineage | Independent, from scratch | Independent (Gecko) | Blink, forked from WebKit ← KHTML | Independent, from scratch |
| CSS engine | Own (`src/css.c`) | Stylo (Rust, from Servo) | Blink style + LayoutNG | Own (LibWeb CSS) |
| Layout | Own (`src/layout.c`) | Reflow frame tree | LayoutNG | Own (LibWeb) |
| JS engine | QuickJS-ng (fork) | SpiderMonkey (own) | V8 (own) | LibJS (own) |
| JIT | **None** (interpreter) | Multi-tier JIT | Multi-tier JIT | Interpreter (bytecode) |
| WebAssembly | WAMR interpreter | SpiderMonkey (JIT) | V8 (JIT) | LibWasm |
| HTML parser | lexbor (vendored) | Own | Own | Own (LibWeb) |
| Page compositing | Cairo software; GPU only for WebGL/WebGPU | WebRender (GPU) | Viz/cc (GPU) | CPU paint (LibGfx/Skia) |
| Networking | libcurl | Necko (own) | Chromium net service (own) | RequestServer (libcurl) |
| Process model | Process-per-tab | Process-per-site (Fission) | Process-per-site (site isolation) | Process-per-tab + service processes |
| IPC | HTTP/JSON + shm framebuffer | IPDL | Mojo | Own IPC compiler over sockets |

### Firefox (Gecko)

Gecko is a mature, independent engine in **C++ and increasingly Rust**:
the CSS engine (**Stylo**) and the compositor (**WebRender**) are Rust
components adopted from Servo, and **SpiderMonkey** is a
multi-tier JIT. Firefox's process model has moved to **Fission** —
site-isolated content processes plus dedicated GPU, socket, and media
(RDD) processes — coordinated over the **IPDL** message system. It is a
GPU-composited, JIT-driven browser optimised for full web performance at
the cost of an enormous, multi-language codebase.

Nordstjernen shares the *independent-engine* stance but inverts almost
every implementation choice: one language (C), no JIT, no Rust
concurrency machinery, software page compositing, and a codebase two
orders of magnitude smaller. Nordstjernen's per-tab renderer with a
seccomp+Landlock sandbox is conceptually similar to a Firefox content
process, but Nordstjernen isolates per **tab**, whereas Fission isolates
per **site**.

### Chrome (Blink)

Blink descends from **WebKit** (itself from KHTML), so unlike
Nordstjernen it is *not* a from-scratch engine, but it is the reference
point for the modern browser architecture: **V8** with a full JIT tier
stack (Ignition → Sparkplug → Maglev → TurboFan), **LayoutNG**, a
Skia-based GPU compositor (**Viz**/cc), a separate **network service**, a
**GPU process**, and strict **site isolation** with one renderer per
site-instance, all wired together with **Mojo** IPC. It is the most
capable and the largest of the four.

Every one of those choices is a scale/performance trade Nordstjernen
declines on purpose. There is no JIT (security and size), no GPU
compositor (a page paints in Cairo; the GPU is used only by the
WebGL/WebGPU producers, which hand back CPU-side pixels), no code-generated
binding layer (bindings are hand-written C in `js.c`), and no Mojo-style
typed-interface IPC (the boundary is human-readable HTTP/JSON). Where
Chrome sends `Sec-CH-UA`/`Sec-Fetch-*`/`Upgrade-Insecure-Requests` to
present a consistent client, Nordstjernen sends the same header set under
a selectable Chrome/Firefox/Ladybird identity so pages that gate on a
mainstream browser environment still run.

### Ladybird (LibWeb / LibJS)

Ladybird is Nordstjernen's closest architectural relative: a **truly
independent, from-scratch engine** (LibWeb + LibJS), originally from
SerenityOS, now cross-platform, and — like Nordstjernen — with **no JIT**
(LibJS is a bytecode interpreter) and a multi-process model that runs the
engine in a dedicated **WebContent** process per tab alongside separate
**RequestServer**, **ImageDecoder**, and **WebWorker** processes.
Ladybird, too, has adopted third-party libraries after going
cross-platform (it uses **libcurl** in RequestServer, plus Skia and
HarfBuzz).

The differences are language and reuse philosophy. Ladybird is **C++**
(with new work moving to Swift) and writes its **JS engine, CSS engine,
and layout all from scratch**, including LibJS. Nordstjernen is **C** and
takes a more pragmatic middle line: it writes its own DOM, CSS, layout,
and paint, but **vendors** a proven JS interpreter (QuickJS-ng), HTML
parser (lexbor), image decoders (Wuffs/libwebp), and wasm runtime (WAMR)
rather than reimplementing them. The result is a much smaller codebase
(~230 K lines of C versus Ladybird's 1M+), a deliberate non-goal of a
from-scratch JS engine, and the distinctive HTTP/JSON+shared-memory IPC
boundary. Both projects share the same north star — a readable,
independent, standards-first browser that is not a rebrand of an existing
engine. There is a source-level JS feature comparison between the two
engines in
[quickjs-libjs-compare.md](quickjs-libjs-compare.md).

### Where Nordstjernen is deliberately different

- **C, not C++/Rust/Swift.** Unusual among modern browsers; keeps the
  toolchain and the mental model small.
- **No JIT anywhere.** A security-first choice (no runtime codegen, no
  W^X surface) accepted at the cost of peak JS/wasm throughput. Ladybird
  shares the no-JIT-JS property; Chrome and Firefox do not.
- **Software page compositing.** The whole page paints in Cairo; the GPU
  is confined to WebGL/WebGPU. No retained-mode GPU compositor.
- **Reuse over reimplementation.** Vendored lexbor/QuickJS/Wuffs/WAMR
  instead of in-house parsers and a from-scratch JS engine — the opposite
  of Ladybird's write-everything approach, and unlike Chrome/Firefox's
  fully in-house engines.
- **Inspectable IPC.** A readable HTTP/JSON control channel plus a
  shared-memory framebuffer, versus the typed binary IPC (Mojo/IPDL/
  Ladybird's IPC compiler) the others use.
- **Auditability as a hard constraint.** ~230 K lines of C is the design
  budget, not an accident. It is what makes one-person review of the
  whole engine feasible, and it is the reason the browser reuses proven
  libraries and declines a GPU compositor and a JIT.
